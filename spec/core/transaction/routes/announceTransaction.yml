summary: Announce a new transaction
description: |
  Announces a transaction to the network.
  The [catbuffer library](https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer) defines the protocol to serialize and deserialize Symbol entities.
  Catbuffers are integrated into [Symbol SDKs](https://nemtech.github.io/sdk.html). 
  It's recommended to use SDKs instead of calling the API endpoint directly to announce transactions.
