summary: Get the merkle path for a given a transaction and block
description: |
  Returns the merkle path for a transaction included in a block.
  The merkle path is the minimum number of nodes needed to calculate the merkle root.

  Steps to calculate the merkle root:
  1. proofHash = hash (leaf)
  2. Contatentate and hash the first item from the merklePath list:
  * a) If item.position == left -> proofHash = sha_256(item.hash + proofHash)
  * b) If item.position == right -> proofHash = sha_256(proofHash+ item.hash)
  3. Repeat 2. for every item in the merkle_path list
  4. Compare if the calculated proofHash equals the one recorded in the
  block header (block.transactionsHash) to verify if the transaction was included in the block.
